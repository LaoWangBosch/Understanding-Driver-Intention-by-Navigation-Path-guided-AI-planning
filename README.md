<p>
Recent advancements in learning-based planning for autonomous driving have demonstrated promising scalability, yet they often suffer from mode collapse or directional deviations, failing to align with human driving intentions.  We identify a critical gap in existing frameworks: the lack of explicit modeling of navigation paths, leading to causal misidentification in planning tasks.  Inspired by human driving behavior, where navigation paths provide high-level guidance, we propose a novel approach that integrates navigation paths as a guide for trajectory planning.  We introduce two versatile frameworks tailored for anchor-based and non-anchor-based methods, addressing the limitations of current systems.  Additionally, we develop a toolchain for automatic navigation path generation and release an extended dataset with navigation annotations.  Extensive evaluations on the extended NavSim benchmark \textit{ and a newly collected driving dataset} demonstrate significant improvements in planning accuracy and safety, showcasing the robustness and transferability of our approach.

We argue that this omission is fundamentally unreasonable. Navigation paths are not only readily available in real-world autonomous driving systems, but they also provide a direct and interpretable way to guide the planning process. Incorporating navigation paths into E2E frameworks offers a straightforward yet powerful solution to the problem of directional deviations in trajectory planning.


To address these challenges and limitations, we propose a new planning methodology titled \textbf{Make E2E Driving Easy Again} A Simple Yet Effective Navigation Path Enhanced Planning Framework. This work builds on the strengths of existing E2E frameworks while addressing their shortcomings by explicitly incorporating navigation paths as a guiding prior for planning.

### Comparison of NAVSIM Trajectory and Recovered Navigation Path

The table below presents a comparative visualization of `NAVSIM` trajectories and our recovered navigation path, computed using the HMM algorithm. 
Each GIF provides a side-by-side comparison, illustrating the differences between the two trajectories across various driving scenarios.

### Impact of Navigation Path on Anchor Trajectories

The figure below illustrates the impact of navigation paths on anchors across different driving scenarios.  
It compares planning results **with and without navigation guidance**, demonstrating how the presence of a navigation path influences trajectory generation.
